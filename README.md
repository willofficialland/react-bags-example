## Known Issues

**Project Setup with create-react-app:**
This project was initially set up using `create-react-app`, which is not recommended by the official React documentation for production projects. It is advisable to use a more structured framework for better maintainability and scalability. As a result, some issues may arise when installing certain packages due to the limitations of the default configuration provided by `create-react-app`. If you encounter such issues, consider migrating to a more robust framework for a smoother development experience.
